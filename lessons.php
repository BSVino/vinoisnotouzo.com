<h1>Lessons learned</h1>

<p>Here I collect lessons I have learned throughout my life. It's a work in progress and will be expanded as I learn more.</p>

<h2>General life</h2>

<ol>
	<li>Treat everybody you meet better than you would have them treat you.</li>
	<li>Think of solutions before problems arise. Be a master of contingency. Be prepared for anything.</li>
	<li>Remember Occam's Razor.</li>
	<li>Never compromise your integrity, even if it hurts you.</li>
	<li>Remember people's names. (There's no better way to make friends.)</li>
	<li>Don't lie, and don't break promises, don't hurt anybody.</li>
	<li>Know how to tell when people lie, when they will break promises, and how they will hurt you.</li>
	<li>Remember Murphy's Law.</li>
	<li>Never hold anybody else to your standards.</li>
	<li>Don't waste time worrying about things that you can't do anything about.</li>
	<li>Stay healthy. Exercise. Push your physical limits. A healthy body leads to a healthy mind.</li>
	<li>Stay smart. Exercise your brain. Engage in intellectualisms. Challenge your mind. A healthy mind leads to a healthy spirit.</li>
	<li>Stay balanced. Meditate. Re-evaluate your life. Reflect on your situation. All is lost without a healthy spirit.</li>
	<li>Remember Sammy Jankis.</li>
	<li>Someone is always trying to eat your lunch. You have to be better than them or you will starve.</li>
	<li>Listen when people criticize you. Don't defend yourself. Fix yourself.</li>
	<li>Strike while the iron is hot.</li>
	<li>The world wasn't designed, it was evolved. Sometimes mysterious things work the way they do for no other reason than that it's they way they always have, not because somebody knows what's going on.</li>
	<li>Beware of anybody who wants you to hate someone else. They want you to do their fighting for them. You don't have to give people a reason to fight each other if you can give them a reason to hate each other.</li>
	<li>No cause is worth the imposition of a foreign will on another person.</li>
	<li>The best way to get people to improve isn't to inspire them or criticize them but to challenge them.</li>
	<li>Most problems caused by being too bold can be fixed by being even more bold. Be bold.</li>
	<li>Everything is forfeit. Never be so attached to something that you can't risk letting it go.</li>
	<li>Don't rely on other people. Be self-reliant.</li>
	<li>Live in the now.</li>
	<li>There are exceptions to every rule, but sometimes you think you're the exception when really you're the rule.</li>
	<li>Most people think they're above average.</li>
	<li>Working smart is a good idea, so long as it's not used as an excuse not to work hard.</li>
	<li>If you hate something about another person, it's because you resent that part of yourself. (Herman Hesse)</li>
	<li>Read, it's good for you.</li>
	<li>Read, it gives you a knowledge advantage.</li>
	<li>Be a student and a leader.</li>
	<li>Admit when you don't know something. (Someone will teach it to you!)</li>
	<li><em>Great minds discuss ideas, average minds discuss events, small minds discuss people.</em> Mainly this is why I don't like sports.</li>
</ol>

<p><em>Never stop</em></p>

<p>Life goes on no matter what I say or do about it, and there will always be someone trying to eat my lunch. Therefore, I can never stop fighting for what is mine and what I believe in. I do not stop because I am tired, or because I am sick, or because I think I have done enough. I always push myself to the next level. I never stop.</p>

<h2>Franklin's</h2>

<ol>
	<li><strong>Temperance.</strong> Eat not to Dulness. Drink not to Elevation. [Don't drink or eat excessively.]</li>
	<li><strong>Silence.</strong> Speak not but what may benefit others or your self. Avoiding trifling Conversation.</li>
	<li><strong>Order.</strong> Let all your Things have their Places. Let each Rart of your Business have its Time. [Organization. Organize your belongings and your schedule.]</li>
	<li><strong>Resolution.</strong> Resolve to perform what you ought. Perform without fail what you resolve.</li>
	<li><strong>Frugality.</strong> Make no Expense but to do good to others or yourself: i.e. Waste nothing. [Franklin was an environmentalist, apparently.]</li>
	<li><strong>Industry.</strong> Lose no Time. Be always employ'd in something useful. Cut of all unnecessary Actions.</li>
	<li><strong>Sincerity.</strong> Use no hurtful Deceit. Think innocently and justly; and if you speak, speak accordingly. [Sincerity means free from pretense, deceit, or hypocracy. Insincere thought creates insincere actions.]</li>
	<li><strong>Justice.</strong> Wrong none, by doing Injuries or omitting the Benefits that are your Duty. [Harm through neglect is as bad as direct.]</li>
	<li><strong>Moderation.</strong> Avoid extremes. Forbear resenting Injuries so much as you think they deserve. [I think he means don't hold grudges.]</li>
	<li><strong>Cleanliness.</strong> Tolerate no Uncleanliness in Body, Clothes or Habitation.</li>
	<li><strong>Tranquility.</strong> Be not disturbed at Trifles, or at Accidents common or unavoidable. [Also: If you can't change it, don't worry about it. Might possibly name this one Serenity.]</li>
	<li><strong>Chastity.</strong> Rarely use Venery but for Health and Offspring; Never to Dulness, Weakness, or the Injury of your own or another's Peace or Reputation. [18th century ideas on chastity perhaps haven't stood the test of time. But the implied disapproval of sexual misconduct is still strong. I might amend it to <strong>Tolerance</strong> or <strong>Inclusion</strong>.]</li>
	<li><strong>Humility.</strong> Imitate Jesus and Socrates. [Humility I get but I think he lost me with his examples. He explains later: <em>I made it a Rule to forbear all direct Contradiction to the Sentiments of others, and all positive Assertion of my own. I even forbid myself, agreeable to the old Laws of our Junto, the Use of every Word or Expression in the LAnguage that imported a fix'd Opinion; such as </em>certainly, undoubtedly,<em> etc. and I adopted instead of them, </em>I conceive, I apprehend, or I imagine<em> a thing to be so or so, or so it appears to me at the present. When another asserted something that I thought an Error, I denied myself the Pleasure of contradicting him abruptly, and of showing immediately some Absurdity in his Proposition...</em>]</li>

<h2>Game Development</h2>

<ol>
<li>Playtesting is king.</li>
<li>Fun is:</li>
<ul>
	<li>Challenge</li>
	<li>Choice - (tradeoffs, risk/reward)</li>
	<li>Gratification</li>
	<li>Eye candy</li>
</ul>
<li>Gamers consider graphics and gameplay to be equally important. <em>(Refer to General rule 3.)</em></li>
<li>Elitists are a vocal minority.</li>
<li>Always know how much information to give to the player, and at what rate and in what order to do it. Too much information and the player is overwhelmed. Too little, and the player is confused.</li>
<li><i>Problems</i> have one definite "best" solution, while <i>Choices</i> are subjective and have no best answer.</li>
<li>No feature is easy to implement. Every feature needs consideration on multiple levels. Visuals, sound, usability, QA.</li>
<li>Just as water seeks its own level, gamers always find the fastest route to a kill, no matter the drawbacks.</li>
<li>No multiplayer action game is worth playing if you can't get into the game in less than 20 seconds and be having fun within another 10.</li>
<li>Don't force players to do something. Instead, provide incentives for them to do it, and let them have fun reaping the rewards.</li>
<li>Use the least amount of plot and exposition as is necessary to tell the story.</li>
<li>Dialogue is for character development, not for plot development.</li>
<li>Games need:</li>
<ul>
	<li>Clear goals</li>
	<li>Immediate feedback</li>
	<li>Appropriate challenge (matched to the user)</li>
	<li>Rewards</li>
</ul>
<li>Give the player a greater purpose.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Entertainment</h2>

<ol>
<li><b>Gabe's Law</b>: You can't show the player a really big bomb and not let them blow it up.</li>
<li>Always leave them wanting more.</li>
<li>Set up expectations and then subvert those expectations.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Business</h2>

<ol>
<li>Reputation reputation reputation.</li>
<li><b>Brooks' Law</b>: Adding manpower to a late project makes it later.</li>
<li><b>Hofstadter's Law</b>: It always takes longer than you expect, even when accounting for Hofstadter's Law.</li>
<li>Try many things. Most will fail, some will work. Learn from the failures.</li>
<li>A smaller and faster deliverable is a better deliverable.</li>
<li>Customers are connections. Create a long-term relationship with them.</li>
<li>Communicate a clear message of intent, strategy, values, and identity to anybody doing work for your company.</li>
<li>In hiring, modesty, communication skills, cultural match, and work ethic are more important than intelligence, skill, and experience.</li>
<li>Only hire people smarter than you.</li>
<li>Seek to make profit by increasing the value of your product, rather than by increasing its price.</li>
<li>Employees are more important than product.</li>
<li>Don't reinvent the wheel. Focus on your company's vision and mission. For everything else, find an external solution.</li>
<li>Pass the monkey.</li>
<li>Cheap, Fast, Quality: pick two.</li>
<li>A good system is one that is sophisticated, but conceals its inner complexity.</li>
<li>Creative/divergent thinking work takes longer when incentivized.</li>
<li>Autonomy, Mastery, Purpose - The three motivators of creative people. Hire amazing people and let them do what they want. Be surprised at the results.</li>
<li>You don't have costs, you have risks.</li>
<li>How to mitigate risk:</li>
<ol><li>Small team</li>
<li>Small scope</li>
<li>Reuse, recycle</li></ol>
<li>Growing a business is like growing a tree. You can give it as much water and sunlight as you want but it still happens slowly. Trying to grow it too fast will only kill it.</li>
<li>What technology is used isn't as important as the preferences of the people who have to use them.</li>
<li>The question isn't, "What's hot?" but rather, "What's going to be hot?"</li>
<li>Working smart is often an excuse for not working hard</li>
<li>If something's not getting done, remove it from your list</li>
<li>From <i>Rework</i> (love that book)</li>
<ol>
	<li>Planning is guessing</li>
	<li>Add profit before employees</li>
	<li>Don't add more employees than you need</li>
	<li>Mission statements are bullshit</li>
	<li>Outside money is plan Z</li>
	<li>You need less than you think (people, money, time, office space, pr, it, support, accounting)</li>
	<li>Avoid mass: contracts, staff, permanent decisions, meetings, process, inventory, tech lockins, road maps, office politics</li>
	<li>Half a kickass product is better than half-assed product</li>
	<li>Ignore details early on</li>
	<li>Cut out unnecessary features</li>
	<li>Focus on what won't change (as opposed to chasing the next big thing)</li>
	<li>Don't hire anybody to do anything you can't do yourself</li>
	<li>Whatever it is, it's not so important that you need it ASAP. Get it done right</li>
</ol>
<li>Some experts can't do, so they "advise." They're short-sighted and they've never done it before.</li>
<li>Customers want innovation and value, not faster, cheaper, better.</li>
<li>Family is more important than shipping.</li>
<li>Educate employees.</li>
<li>Hit-centric releases will starve a company. Build an ongoing revenue stream.</li>
</ol>
