  <h1>Six Levels of Creative Opinion</h1>

<h2>1. "I have no creative opinion."</h2>
<p>A neophyte to a subject usually starts with no opinion. There's nothing wrong with this level. It's probably better than most of the following levels.</p>
<h2>2. "I think we should do X."</h2>
<p>A person at this level is expressing their opinion in the most basic way. They have maybe done X before, and have seen it work well. Or, they're completely uninformed about whether X work would and are only enamored with their novel idea.</p>
<h2>3. "I think we should try X."</h2>
<p>A person at this level has enough experience to know that they are wrong often. Therefore this person admits that they could be wrong now, and signals to others that they aren't too bought in to their own idea.</p>
<h2>4. "We can either try X or Y."</h2>
<p>A person at this level no longer has tunnel vision to a single idea. Multiple ideas can be valid and in flight at the same time. This person has many times seen ideas they thought were good be improved on by other ideas, and is no longer attached to whichever their first idea is.</p>
<h2>5. "We should try all things."</h2>
<p>A person at this level thinks it's not worth it to limit their thinking to a finite number of possibilities. It's of course not possible to try all things, but one can at least try things and learn what doesn't work.</p>
<h2>6. "I have no creative opinion."</h2>
<p>A person at this level realizes they don't really know anything. Every creative statement is subjective and can be wrong given the right context. In the long run it's often not worth pushing any particular opinion, so long as a coherent bigger picture eventually emerges.</p><br clear="both" />
